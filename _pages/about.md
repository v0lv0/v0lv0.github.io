Hi there\
My name is Daniel Jin(é‡‘). I am currently MS student in Computer Science at NYU Courant, having completed my undergraduate studies at Rutgers University with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in Linguistics.

I am passionate about **"making sense"**. Which (un?)luckily has becoming more important and difficult in the recent years with the advancement of generative AI; As these models operate in ways that often feel like a black box, my goal is not just to use them but to understand and explain its inner workings.

This passion for making sense has led me to develop a diversed background, here are some of them: (``sort(interests, key=lambda x: -len(x))``)
- AI 
- NLP
- compilers
- redictive analytics
- formal language theory
- computational linguistics
- algorithms (especially graph theory)

Notably, I have been teaching computer science at the university level since 2019, thanks to the awsome [Learning Assistant (LA) Program](https://ceils.ucla.edu/learning-communities-trainings/learning-assistant-program/). Since then, I have led recitation sections, designed course materials for **intro to computer science and data structures**. Which has helped thousands of students to the path of computer science. Other than that, I've worked as an intern in 2024 as a product manager for LLM 2C product at Baidu, and currently working on predictive analysis paper on NYC public transit's relationship with retail.

As right now, I thrive at the intersection of **AI, NLP, and computational linguistics**, aiming not only to use the technology but also to **explain them**.
