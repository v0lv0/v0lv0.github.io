# About Me
Hi there, my name is Daniel Jin(é‡‘). I am currently pursuing an **M.S. in Computer Science** at **NYU Courant**, having completed my undergraduate studies at **Rutgers University** with a **double major in Computer Science and Mathematics** and a **minor in Linguistics**.

I am passionate about **"making sense"**. Which (un?)luckily has becoming more important and difficult in the recent years with the advancement of generative AI; As these models operate in ways that often feel like a **black box**, my goal is not just to use AI effectively but to **understand and explain** its inner workings.

This passion for making sense has led me to develop a diversed background, including **computational linguistics, formal language theory, compilers, algorithms (especially graph theory), NLP, AI, and predictive analytics**.

Notably, I have been teaching computer science at the university level since 2019, thanks to the awsome [Learning Assistant (LA) Program](https://ceils.ucla.edu/learning-communities-trainings/learning-assistant-program/). Since then, I have led recitation sections, designed course materials for **intro to computer science and data structures**. Which has helped thousands of students to the path of computer science.

As today, I thrive at the intersection of **AI, NLP, and computational linguistics**, aiming not only to use the technology but also to **explain them**.
