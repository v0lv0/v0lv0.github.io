I am currently studying for a MS degree in Computer Science at NYU Courant. I recently completed my undergraduate studies at Rutgers University, where I completed a BS degree with major in Computer Science, General Mathematics and a minor in Linguistics. I am genuinely passionate to explore the beauty of logic and mathematics, and I am excited to continue pursuing into these subjects during my academic journey.
